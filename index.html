      <p><b>1) STATEMENT:</b> The widespread use of plastic products has led to severe environmental pollution, particularly in oceans where marine life is threatened.<br><b>CONCLUSION:</b></p>
      <div class="options">
        <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="A"> A) Plastic pollution is a significant cause of harm to marine ecosystems.</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="B"> B) Pollution in oceans is mainly caused by industrial waste, not plastics.</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="C"> C) Marine life is unaffected by the presence of plastics in oceans.</label>
        <label><input type="radio" name="q1" value="D"> D) Plastic products have no connection to environmental pollution.</label>

      </div>
      <div class="explanation" id="exp1">
        ✅ Correct Answer: A<br>
        Explanation: The statement directly links the widespread use of plastics to environmental pollution and the threat it poses to marine life. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that plastic pollution significantly harms marine ecosystems.

        <label><input type="radio" name="q2" value="E"> E) They can score good marks without studying hard or continuously.</label>
      </div>
      <div class="explanation" id="exp2">
        ✅ Correct Answer: C<br>
        Explanation: The statement suggests that studying hard and continuously is a way to achieve good marks, but it does not guarantee success. Other factors can affect results. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that studying hard increases the likelihood of good marks, but it isn’t an absolute assurance.
